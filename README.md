- 👋 Hi, I’m @alistaircroll
- 👀 I’m interested in how tech is changing society
- 🌱 I’m currently learning entertainment analytics, digital government, Ableton
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on figuring out the entertainment economy, writing about subversive go-to-market strategy, virtual and hybrid events, analytics.
- 📫 I'm @acroll on most platforms, and alistaircroll.com.
- I'm a product manager; I coded a long time ago, and I'm experimenting with some new projects so I have a better understanding of how AI can help non-engineers like me build things.
